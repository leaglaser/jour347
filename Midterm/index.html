<h4>The total solar eclipse set to occur April 8, 2024, will dazzle everyone who views it. However, potential observers might have some questions.

Where exactly in Mexico and the U.S. will totality be visible? That’s easy to answer with a detailed map, such as the one below. But which locations are the best spots to view the event? That answer is less straightforward.?
<br><br>
You’ll surely want to set up shop near the center line of the eclipse, where totality will last the longest. But what else makes for a good viewing site for a total solar eclipse? Below are 20 great locations you should consider for the 2024 Great North American Eclipse, starting in Mexico and working to the Northeast U.S.</h4>

<br><br><br>
<p><b>Mazatlán, Sinaloa, Mexico</b> 
<br>
The Moon’s umbra touches the coast of the United Mexican States at 12:07 p.m. Mexican Pacific Daylight Time less than 12 miles (19 km) southeast of Mazatlán, which was one of the main destinations for travelers viewing the July 11, 1991 total solar eclipse. This city knows how to host a large influx of travelers, so it’s a good bet that it will be a prime destination.
<br><br>
Eclipse starts: 9:51:28 a.m. MPDT<br>
Eclipse ends: 12:32:11 p.m. MPDT<br>
Maximum eclipse: 11:09:39 a.m. MPDT<br>
Sun’s altitude at maximum eclipse: 69.1°<br>
Duration of totality: 4 minutes 18 seconds<br>
Width of Moon’s shadow: 123.7 miles (199.1 km)<br>
<br><br>
<b>Radar Base, Texas</b>
<br>
For eclipse chasers who want the greatest possible amount of totality without leaving the U.S., consider Radar Base, which lies right on the U.S.–Mexico border. Its name, by the way, isn’t that of a military base but instead a small town of several hundred residents. That number will balloon on eclipse day, so be sure to get there early.
<br><br>
Eclipse starts: 12:10:26 p.m. CDT<br>
Eclipse end: 2:51:30 p.m. CDT<br>
Maximum eclipse: 1:29:53 p.m. CDT<br>
Sun’s altitude at maximum eclipse: 68.5°<br>
Duration of totality: 4 minutes 27 seconds<br>
Width of Moon’s shadow: 120.9 miles (195.5 km)<br>
<br><br>
<b>Russellville, Arkansas</b>
<br>
With a population near 30,000, Russellville has enough resources to host a moderate influx of visitors for the eclipse. Those eclipse chasers who prefer to observe the event outside the city could head for nearby Mount Nebo, a flat-topped mountain that rises 1,350 feet (410 meters) above the surrounding valley.
<br><br>
Eclipse starts: 12:33:08 p.m. CDT<br>
Eclipse ends: 3:10:46 p.m. CDT<br>
Maximum eclipse: 1:52:10 p.m. CDT<br>
Sun’s altitude at maximum eclipse: 49.0°<br>
Duration of totality: 4 minutes 11 seconds<br>
Width of Moon’s shadow: 117.2 miles (188.6 km)<br>
<br><br>
<b>Cape Girardeau, Missouri</b>
<br>
The largest city in southeastern Missouri that will experience totality is Cape Girardeau, with its 80,000 residents. It lies on the bank of the Mississippi River and is easily accessible from Interstate 55. For an additional 4 seconds of totality, eclipseophiles can head 10 miles (16 km) west on State Route 72 to Jackson.
<br><br>
Eclipse starts: 12:41:51 p.m. CDT<br>
Eclipse ends: 3:17:26 p.m. CDT<br>
Maximum eclipse: 2:00:21 p.m. CDT<br>
Sun’s altitude at maximum eclipse: 57.3°<br>
Duration of totality: 4 minutes 6 seconds<br>
Width of Moon’s shadow: 115.5 miles (185.9 km)<br>
</p>
<br>
<br><br>
<div class="callout customCallout">
All things being equal, a town of 10,000 is much more likely to have event-related problems than a city of 75,000. Traffic will be one of the primary issues; small communities with one main road may suffer hours of gridlock. If you opt to travel to such a location, get there early — perhaps even a day or two ahead of the eclipse.</div>
<br><br>
<p><b>Indianapolis, Indiana</b>
<br>
The umbra will cover a wide swath of Indiana, but most of the attention will focus on the state’s capital city. Downtown Indianapolis is a metropolis served by four interstate highways and will surely be one of the most sought-after destinations. It offers plentiful lodging, excellent cuisine, and many attractions for travelers.
<br><br>
Eclipse starts: 1:50:31 p.m. EDT<br>
Eclipse ends: 4:23:10 p.m. EDT<br>
Maximum eclipse: 3:07:56 p.m. EDT<br>
Sun’s altitude at maximum eclipse: 53°<br>
Duration of totality: 3 minutes 49 seconds<br>
Width of Moon’s shadow: 114 miles (183.4 km)<br>
<br><br>
<p><b>Cleveland, Ohio</b>
<br>
With a metro population of more than 2 million, this city will host a multitude of eclipse chasers. Get there a couple of days early, and fill the waiting time with visits to some of Cleveland’s highlights, including the Cleveland Museum of Arts and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
<br><br>
Eclipse starts: 1:59:20 p.m. EDT<br>
Eclipse ends: 4:28:57 p.m. EDT<br>
Maximum eclipse: 3:15:37 p.m. EDT<br>
Sun’s altitude at maximum eclipse: 48.6°<br>
Duration of totality: 3 minutes 49 seconds<br>
Width of Moon’s shadow: 111.9 miles (180.1 km)<br>
<br><br>
<p><b> Buffalo, New York</b>
<br>
The largest city in New York that will experience the Moon’s umbra is Buffalo, with its metropolitan population of 1.1 million. The center line passes right through downtown, so expect all activity to come to a screeching halt in mid-afternoon. Travelers desiring information about the eclipse might want to check with the staff of Zygmunt Planetarium, which is part of the Buffalo Museum of Science.
<br><br>
Eclipse starts: 2:04:54 p.m. EDT<br>
Eclipse ends: 4:32:07 p.m. EDT<br>
Maximum eclipse: 3:20:11 p.m. EDT<br>
Sun’s altitude at maximum eclipse: 45.6°<br>
Duration of totality: 3 minutes 45 seconds<br>
Width of Moon’s shadow: 110.7 miles (178.2 km)<br>
<br><br>
<p><b> Mars Hill, Maine</b>
<br>
To be honest, Mars Hill is a small town of some 1,500 residents. But just think of it: an amateur astronomer watching the Moon cover the Sun from a place named Mars Hill? Terrific. This location also is one of the last spots in the U.S. to see totality. But if you’re one of those serious types, just drive 20 miles (32 km) south for an additional 10 seconds of totality.
<br><br>
Eclipse starts: 2:22:20 p.m. EDT<br>
Eclipse ends: 4:40:52 p.m. EDT<br>
Maximum eclipse: 3:33:41 p.m. EDT<br>
Sun’s altitude at maximum eclipse: 35.2°<br>
Duration of totality: 3 minutes 12 seconds<br>
Width of Moon’s shadow: 106.2 miles (171 km)<br>
