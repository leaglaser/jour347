 <p><p class="first-word-uppercase-p"> Like thousands of other teenagers around the world, University of Maryland students enter their freshman year with intentions to pursue a degree at ages 17 or 18. 
<br><br>
But these degrees eventually lead to careers they pursue for the rest of their lives. Ultimately, a decision made as a young adult becomes something they are stuck with. 41 UMD students were surveyed to see if they regretted their intended majors and if they changed to a different field of study.
<br><br>
The university offers over <a href="https://admissions.umd.edu/programs" target="_blank">100 majors and 80 minors</a>, scattered between 12 different colleges. UMD also offers passionate students the opportunity to double major or earn a dual-degree. Despite numerous options, 29.3% of  students surveyed said they regret picking their area of study and were overwhelmed when deciding before starting their freshman year. 
<br><br>
<u>Here are the top reasons why students rue their original majors:</u>
</p>
<br><br><br><br>
<h3><strong> Lack of Post-College Jobs </strong></h3>
<br><br>
<p>63.4% of students surveyed considered changing their major at one point in their college career. The most common area of studies students would switch to were business and communications. Students said these majors support an easier course load and flexibility of career choices after college compared to their own study specializations.
<br><br>
Anju Rajah, a sophomore operations management business analytics and information systems double major, began her college journey as a data science and management double major. Rajah entered her freshman year with hopes of becoming a data analyst. But midway through her sophomore year, she derailed to a different path.
<br><br>
“I originally chose data science and management for the in-depth java and python courses,” Rajah said. “But then I realized it wasn’t for me. I felt out of place in my classes and regret not switching to information systems earlier so I can graduate on time.”
<br><br>
Rajah is one of many UMD students who changed their original college major. 34.1% of students surveyed said they’ve switched majors during their time at the university.
<br><br>
Students also commonly agreed that post-college opportunities should be more inviting. According to Andrew Van Dam of the Washington Post, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/09/02/college-major-regrets/" target="_blank"> 2 in 5 Americans </a> with a college degree regret their major. Respondents said too many jobs require a specific degree, making it more difficult for people to get a job aside from what they earned a degree in.

<h3><strong> Too Early in Life to Pick a Career Path</strong></h3>
<br><br><br>
<p>100% of respondents said the age they entered college was too young to choose a life career path. High school students applying to colleges begin their application process the summer or fall before 12th grade. Many students felt senior year of high school was more focused around physically sending in fully-formed applications and less on picking a specific major. 
<br><br>
Nearly five years will pass from the original major decision to the time the student graduates from undergraduate school.
<br><br>
With many options to strive toward, students said the specific courses sounded appealing on first look. The more the students became involved with the major, the more they realized the future career options were not what they wanted.
<br><br>
Cloe Harris, a sophomore nursing major, transferred from Johnson & Wales University in Rhode Island her second year. Harris entered UMD as a nutrition student, interested in becoming a sports nutritionist for a professional athletic team. But as she maneuvered her way through the program, she became more aware of how the profession would treat her in the long run.

<div class="pullQuote">
<strong>“I followed a high school dream,” Harris said. “Obviously I still have those dreams but I want the job security that nursing has, as well as the many different departments you can work in. It isn’t as restrictive as nutrition is.”</strong>

<h3><strong> It’s Too Late to Change</strong></h3>
<br><br><br>
<p>20% of respondents who haven’t changed their majors indicated that they once considered doing so. These students agreed the main factor in their decision to not change was because it was ultimately too late in their college career to do so. 
<br><br>
Emma Frantz, a junior mechanical engineering major, came to a realization the summer before her sophomore year. Frantz said she would rather study civil engineering but decided to stick with mechanical engineering because it would require two extra semesters. She wanted to graduate in four years.
<br><br>
Students like Frantz also said it was expensive to go beyond the originally four-year plan most majors have listed.
<br><br>
“I definitely felt lost right before my third semester,” Frantz said. “I kept looking for options to switch majors but it would’ve required me to take an extra semester which I didn’t want to do. It almost felt like a waste of time if I ditched the classes I already took.”
<br><br>
Despite exceeding the scheduled eight semesters, 29.8% of respondents said they would take extra classes after four years if it meant pursuing a degree they were interested in.

<div class="large-12, medium-12, small-12">
<p> Despite being a tough task, teenagers feel pressured when it comes time to decide on their college majors. The University of Maryland offers the option to double major but at a greater cost than simply majroing in one field. American college students ultimately often end up confused after graduation trying to figure out their careers.
<br><br>
Eleven students surveyed said choosing a college major was the hardest decision they've had to make. </p>
