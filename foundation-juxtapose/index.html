          <h5><u>A Brief History of Baltimore</u></h5>
                <p>Baltimore was established as a town in 1730 with sixty losts of one-acre each. Buildings began to increase in production by the 1750s. The city became a rivaling city to Philadelphia, Boston and New York due to its surplus of tobacco. 
                <br><br><br>
                Irish, Scottish and German families began to immigrant to the area and increased the city's growing economy. Baltimore became a naval superiority during the Revolutionary War. In 1816, the city reached 46,000 residents and beame the fatest growing city in the country.
                <br><br><br>
                During the War of 1812, shipbuilders built some of the world's fatests and most efficient ships. Francis Scott Key wrote a poem that turned in to the national anthem, the 'Stars Spangled Banner', during the war. The city became a hub for transport, trade and travel, as it was on the Chesapeake Bay and near New York and Philadelphia, two of the country's largest cities.
                <br><br><br>
                By 1910, Baltimore's population grew to 558,485. But as people came, crime and violence increased. In 1999, the city was titled as the most dangerous city in America. Baltimore is known for its bustling crabs, sporty atmosphere and historical charm.</p>
